## What is HANDS ON KEYS?

![HANDS ON KEYS banner](/images/handsonkeysbanner.jpg)

[HANDS ON KEYS](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hands-on-keys/) is a tech blog for developers. I'm hoping to provide as much value to developers as I possibly can, and will do so from a "hands on" perspective.

This will also allow me to get more reps as a technical communicator, story teller, and developer!

## Current Status

I'm in the process now of brainstorming topics to write about. Feel free to reach out with any suggestions!

In the meantime, take a look at my first article: [Free Cloud Learning w/ Databricks Community Edition](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/free-cloud-learning-w-databricks-community-edition-hands-on-keys-rbqqc/?trackingId=DscoapRbsdNKwJGOP0bdvQ%3D%3D)

It describes how to set up a FREE instance of [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) thru its [Community Edition](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/community-edition.html).

See you on the Internet!

-Noah
