Welcome to my website! <!--more--> I've recently been laser focuesed on taking my skills as a developer to the next level. I keep hearing a voice in my head telling me I can be good at this, and im at the point where im ready to listen to it.

Here is a bit of my backgound:

1. Born in Hoover, Alabama - Middle child
2. Graduated with a Mechanical Engienering degree
3. Did Tax Consulting for a year (random I know)
4. To learn how to code, I started learning HTML + CSS + Python in September 2020
5. Got my first tech job January 2021 in Data Engineering
6. Now I'm here

I love connecting with people and being of service.

I'm also trying to write, draw more, and make some [beats](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1V9q9cOERY90Rtw8EyLgYC?si=bd645cf2e73049c5).

I don't really know what I want to do with this yet. 

The Journey is the Destination!

I'll have some tech tips. I may post some art here and there. I am definetly open to suggestions!

Reach out and let me know what you would like to see!

Stay well.
