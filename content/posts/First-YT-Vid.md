## The Pop Out

I have been watching YouTube for my entire life.

Studying, Laughing, _Learning_.

I watch it more than TV.

Today, I took another step in my content creation journey with by releasing my first video!

It's definetly me doing my best Super GT impression, but I'm proud of how it turned out.

## Behind the Scenes
I've been Sim Racing for over a year now.

 I felt a Gran Turismo 7 commentary would be the perfect place for me to start my video production journey. 

GT7 is my hobby, its fun, and I know the material! 

To produce the video, I utilized [Share Factory Studio](https://www.google.com/search?q=share+factory+studio&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1017US1017&oq=share+factore+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCwgBEAAYChgNGIAEMgYIABBFGDkyCwgBEAAYChgNGIAEMggIAhAAGBYYHjIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCggHEAAYDxgWGB4yCggIEAAYDxgWGB4yCggJEAAYDxgWGB7SAQgzNTQxajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

 This allowed me to create and edit the video right on my PS5. 

While creating, I found it helpful to edit the gameplay first, and then add the commentary after everything was chopped up to my liking.

 By studying [@SuperGT](https://youtu.be/ro3XAnqmU4A?si=DSE8uou8RFyutNbU)'s videos, I was able to take notes, create my own outline, and complete the video! 
 
 Doing the commentary is harder than you would think, so having a outline of talking points is really helpful in telling a coherent story.

After editing, I was able to share directly to YouTube. I really reccommend any PS5 users to give the Share Factory Studio a try!


## Looking forward

This is just the beginning.

I'm planning to also be posting to my other channels in the coming months. 

[@ARKDATASTUDIOS](https://www.youtube.com/@ArkDataStudios) will have my company content.

[@NoahPitts713](https://www.youtube.com/@NoahPitts713) will be where I talk tech and data!

I'm using these channels as reps to help me get comfortable speaking and find my voice!

Subscribe to stay informed and as always, Ill see you on the internet!
