## MaXXXine

[MaXXXine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0uS3t6nFgY) is a 2024 thriller film written, directed, produced, and edited by [Ti West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti_West). This is the thrid film in the trilogy, and I am a big fan of the first two. So much so, I decided to treat the night as a double feature, and watched [Pearl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5PW5r3pEOg) beforehand. I was really excited walking into the theatre for this one!

## Thoughts on MaXXXine

I loved it.

 Coming in at 104 minutes, it felt very well paced. Not a lot of wasted scenes and it was able to keep my attention throught its runtime. I've been telling all my people to go and check it out if you need soemthing to do on a Friday night.

## How MaXXXine made me feel

Inspired.

 A recurring theme througout the trilogy is feeling like a STAR.
 
 In this film, protagonist Maxine Minx is hungry, and is continuing her quest to becoming a STAR.

 I also feel like im on a quest to feel like a STAR, so seeing her journey just really speaks to me in a way I cant fully explain (yet).
 

## Final thoughts on MaXXXine 

Ti West has earned my respect.

 All 3 films are very different from each other, but compliment each other well. While my favoirte film of the trilogy is still [Pearl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5PW5r3pEOg&t=2s), all 3 films are very strong entries. I think a good sign of a good movie is passing the *"will you watch it again?"* test. 
 
 It passes - I'd watch **all three** films again.

## Fun Facts

While watching the end credits (I know i'm a sicko) - I noticed the lawyer & law office for the film was [The Law Firm of Stacey A. Davis](https://staceydavislaw.com/about-us)

Three cool things about Stacey and her Firm:

1. She was listed in the credits *twice* since she is the **owner** and **attorney** at her office! 

1. Her office is headquarted in my hometown of **Birmingham, Alabama**! I would have never known I was so close to Hollywood growing up, but the world just gets smaller each day!

1. She is an **award winning** film maker! I'm hoping to find a place to check out her film *CHERRY* - which is about a strait-laced mother of two getting high with her dying father on Easter Sunday.
